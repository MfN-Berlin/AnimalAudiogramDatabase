# Welcome to the Animal Audiogram Database GitHub repo.
The Animal Audiogram Database (AAD) assembles audiogram data, metadata about the corresponding experiments, and links to original publications in a consistent format.

The database is accessible here: https://animalaudiograms.museumfuernaturkunde.berlin

The database is drafted as a **free and open resource** whose structure and content can be extended by **collaborative development** for audiogram data from any taxonomic group and habitat.

**This repository** serves to collate resources in the context of the database and foster joint, collaborative development of the database's contents and features.
